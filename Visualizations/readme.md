# Visualizations

This folder contains visualizations created by our team for our capstone project. These visualizations are designed to support our company's insights and include the following types of files:

- **Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb)**: Interactive notebooks containing Python code and outputs, including graphs and data insights.
- **Power BI**: Visualizations made in Power BI for data analytics and presentation.

## Folder Structure
- `Jupyter_Notebooks/` - Folder for `.ipynb` files with analysis and visualizations.
- `PowerBI/` - Folder for Power BI project files and exported visualizations.

Each folder contains project-specific graphs and analysis files to provide insights and visual data representations.
